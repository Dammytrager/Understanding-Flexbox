## The Flex Container Properties

`Flex-direction || Flex-wrap || Flex-flow || Justify-content || Align-items || Align-content`

![Understanding flexbox - flex-container](http://i.imgur.com/xK4JUVX.jpg)

In the last article, I established some core principles. What flex-containers and flex-items are, and how to initiate the Flexbox model. Now is a good time to put all of that to good use. So, brace up.

Having set a parent element as a flex container, a couple of **alignment properties** are made available to be used on the flex container.  
Just like you'd define the width property on a block element as `width: 200px`, there are 6 different properties the flex container can take on, and defining these properties do NOT take a different approach.

### 1. Flex-direction

The `Flex-direction` property may take any of four values:, and it controls the direction in which the flex items are laid along the main axis.

```css
/*where ul represents a flex container*/
ul {
  flex-direction: row || column || row-reverse || column-reverse;
}
```

The `flex-direction` property let's us decide how the **flex items** are laid out. Either horizontally, vertically or reversed in both directions.  
Technically, horizontal and vertical isn't what it's called in the _"flex world"_. These are described as **main-axis** and **cross axis**, and the defaults are shown below:

![main axis](http://i.imgur.com/8DgaIMV.jpg)

By default, the `flex-direction` property is set to `row` and it aligns the flex-item(s) along the main axis. This explains what happened with our unordered list at the start of this article. Even though `flex-direction` property wasn't explicitly set, it took on the default value of `row` and so the flex items were laid across the main-axis, stacking horizontally from left to right.

### 2. Flex-wrap

The flex wrap property can take on any of three values:

```css
//where ul represents a flex container
ul {
  flex-wrap: wrap || nowrap || wrap-reverse;
}
```

Let's try sticking in a lot more list items within our unordered list. What do you think? Will our flex container resize or break up the list items?

```html
/*adding 3 more li elements*/
<ul> <!--parent element-->
  <li></li> <!--first child element-->
  <li></li> <!--second child element-->
  <li></li> <!--third child element-->
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

Fortunately, the flex-container adapts to accommodate our new flex-items

So let's go a bit further...Add a ridiculous amount of flex-items to our parent element. I choose 10 more items. What happens??

![Image of much more children elements added to a flex container](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_5_zpste0kkkru.png)

Again, the flex container adapts to fit all children in, even if I need to scroll my browser horizontally.  
This is the default behavior of every flex container. It keeps on accommodating more flex items on a single line because the `flex-wrap` property defaults to `nowrap`.

```css
ul {
  flex-wrap: nowrap; /*Keep on taking more flex items without breaking (wrapping)*/
}
```

Well, with that number of flex-items, you certainly want the flex-container to 'wrap' around these elements. i.e. When the available space can no longer support the flex-items, break unto multiple lines when needed, and with that comes the `wrap` value

```css
ul {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

With this, the flex items now break up into multiple lines when needed. In this case, when a single line can no longer contain all the list items in their default width, they break up into multiple lines. Even on resizing the browser!!

![Image of much more children elements now in multiple lines](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_6_zpscnqcf7my.png)

There's one more value, `wrap-reverse`. Yes, you guessed right. It lets the flex items break unto multiple lines but in the reverse direction.

### 3. Flex-flow

The `flex-flow` is a shorthand property which takes `flex-direction` and `Flex-wrap` values. Ever used the `border` shorthand property? `border: 1px solid red`. It's the same concept here. Multiple values declared in one line.

Re-writing the code above would yield this:

```css
ul {
  flex-flow: row wrap; /*direction 'row' and yes, please wrap the items.*/
}
```

![image explaining the flex-flow property](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/flexbox-flex-flow_zpshybxvgcy.jpg)

Try out the other combinations this could take. `flex-flow: row nowrap`, `flex-flow: column wrap`, `flex-flow: column nowrap`
I'm sure you understand what those would produce. Give it a try.

### 4. Justify-content

Life's really good with the flexbox model! If you still doubt that, the justify-content property would convince you. It may take on any of these 5 values:

```css
ul {
  justify-content: flex-start || flex-end || center || space-between ||
    space-around;
}
```

And what exactly does the justify content property bring to the table? Well, It may remind you of the text-align property.

The justify content property defines how flex items are laid out on the main axis.

Consider the simple unordered list below:

```html
<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>
```

Adding up some basic styling...

```css
ul {
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  background-color: #e8e8e9;
}

li {
  background-color: #8cacea;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 8px;
  padding: 4px;
}
```

We have this:

With the `justify-content property`, the three flex-items may be aligned across the main-axis in whatever way you desire. Here's the breakdown of what's possible.

Fist off, the default value, `flex-start`, groups all flex-items to the start of the main axis.

```css
ul {
  justify-content: flex-start;
}
```

![flex-start](http://i.imgur.com/Ct9Q1P5.png)

`flex-end` groups the flex-items to the end of the main axis.

```css
ul {
  justify-content: flex-end;
}
```

![flex-end](http://i.imgur.com/Rn3C5oL.png)

`Center` does just you'd expect - centering the flex items along the main axis.

```css
ul {
  justify-content: center;
}
```

![flex-center](http://i.imgur.com/kpm0rG0.png)

`Space-between` keeps the same space between each flex item.

```css
ul {
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

![space-between](http://i.imgur.com/cUYgqJs.png)

Uhmm, did you notice anything different here? Take a look again:

![Understanding-Flexbox, Space between](http://i.imgur.com/lH5HtXV.jpg)

Finally, `space-around` keeps the same spacing around flex items.

```css
ul {
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

![space-around](http://i.imgur.com/anlXv8t.png)

A second look doesn't hurt:

Don't worry if these seem like too much to get a hold of. With a bit of practice you will get very comfortable with the syntax.

### 5. Align-items

The `align-items` property is somewhat similar to the `justify-content` property. Having understood the `justify-content` property, this should be easier to take in.

`Align-items` can be set to any of these values: flex-start || flex-end || center || stretch || baseline

```css
/*ul represents any flex container*/
ul {
  align-items: flex-start || flex-end || center || stretch || baseline;
}
```

It defines how flex-items are laid out on the **cross axis**. This is the difference between the `align-items` property and `justify-content`.

**The default value is `stretch`, and this will 'stretch' the flex-items so they fill the entire height of the flex container.**

![stretch](http://i.imgur.com/z6hibEr.png)

**The `flex-start` and `flex-end` properties do what you expect - group the items to the start or end of the cross-axis.**

![flex-start](http://i.imgur.com/7IWXXP3.png)

![flex-end](http://i.imgur.com/F0zDNT1.png)

**The `center` value is equally predictable. It aligns items to the center of the flex-container.**

![center](http://i.imgur.com/qSPeH9E.png)

**And the baseline value? It aligns flex-items along their baselines.**

![baseline](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_17_zpsovbaj6w0.png)

"Baseline" really sounds fancy. It appears to look just like `flex-start` but it is subtly different. What the heck is "baseline"? This should help:

Isn't it awesome the amount of layout control you have here?

### 6. Align-content

Remember when you added more list elements to our unordered list? You got a multi-line flex container by using the `flex-wrap` property. The `align-content` property is used on multi-line flex-containers.

It takes the same values as `align-items` apart from `baseline`. By definition, it controls how the flex-items are aligned in a multi-line flex container. Just like `align-items`, the default value is also `stretch`

These are values you're familiar with. So, here's how they affect a multi-line flex-container.

**Stretch**

![stretch](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_18_zpsy8iaetza.png)

**Flex-start**

![flex-start](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_19_zpsdumnrbis.png)

**Flex-end**

![flex-end](http://i1064.photobucket.com/albums/u363/Ohans_Emmanuel/flexbox-article/Screenshot_20_zpsvtll0vn0.png)

**Center**

...and that concludes this. You now understand how to use the various flex-container properties. Pretty soon, you'll need these to work through the practical sections coming up. I guess you're feeling much more confident now, right?
